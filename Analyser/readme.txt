In order to compile, you need first to:

. /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/gcc/4.9/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/setup.sh
. /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/app/releases/ROOT/6.06.06/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/root/bin/thisroot.sh

Finally, just do:
make

Binary files will be created in the same path!

Files with "Leading" use Leading Leptons to reconstruct the missing mass. Without, reproduce the signal we have been seen!
